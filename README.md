Paws for Consideration - https://pawsforconsideration.herokuapp.com/

Administrative website for fictitious animal rescue, "Paws for Consideration". The site allows employees of the rescue to view the cats
and dogs currently in the care of the rescue, view the staff of the rescue, view locations where animals are housed in the rescue, and
assign or remove staff from location assignments. 

For the back-end, this site utilizes JawsDB (running MySQL) and Node.js. JawsDB is a Heroku add-on for providing a MySQL Database server
for use with the Heroku instance. JawsDB was chosen over ClearDB as it allows for usage of a more up to date version of MySQL, which is
necessary in order to utilize CTEs. Node.js is utilizing express for the web server and is using EJS for displaying the front-end views.

The front-end styling is a combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS.
